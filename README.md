## Overview
  In this challenge we have to code the given design of what frontend mentor named as Base Apparel coming soon page. These are comparatively easy challanges in newbie section. The screenshot below shows you my take on this challenge.

## My process

I always try to get as close as possible to the provided design. As the free section of frontend mentor does not include any figma or actual dimensions rather an style guide which includes screen-size, colors, font-family,  so I had to just eye ball things.

    - First I try to identify the blocks in which I can divide the website,then further divide them into children div so it will be little easier for me to manage them.
    - Then I compare things that are similar in mobile view and desktop view.
    - In this challenge I tried to approach with the mobile first design technique.
    

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Javascript

### What I learned
  In this challenge I learned the basics of Javascript DOM manipulation, also a lot about how to manage the responsiveness of the page.
  Managing HTML `img` element is little bit difficult rather then inserting and image with help of `background: url()` , or at least I felt it like that in this challenge. Because of the `background-size: cover` property I think its much more easier in this way to make reacting the image with respect to the screen size.
  However this method has its own drawback like, it wont work according to image's height and width. We have to provide both height and width otherwise it will be not be seen in the screen.

### Useful resources

I took help from this tutorial for the input error styling.
